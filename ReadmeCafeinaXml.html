        <h1>CAFEINA XML</h1>
        <hr />
        <br />
        Cafeina Xml is a Microsoft.Net library that allows you to easily persist entities in the globally supported Xml standard.
        It brings you a fast way to serialize, store and restore your objects with less code-lines than you ever seen.
        It's user friendly and you don't need to create data enviroments in order to deploy your app, Cafeina Xml will
        do everything for you.<br /><br />
        Cafeina Xml will not replace a DBMS in some enviroments like heavily transactional ones, but it will help you in too many
        cases to quickly create and deploy any kind of applications in web or desktop enviroments.<br /><br />
        The next version we are preparing, will include features to improve multi-user access and tons of cool things that you'll love.
        While we finish it, try this version of Cafeina Xml and be amazed of its easiness and power.<br /><br />
        Less Sql, more fun, happy Computing!<br /><br />
        Cafeina Team.
