# CafeinaXml

By Daniel Ca√±izares Corrales

This was my try to create a .Net library to persist entities using xml files.

It was useful for me in some desktop projects but the library hasn't been updated for so long. 
I made this as a student, but I hope that someone will find something helpful inside it.

# Readme

Cafeina Xml is a Microsoft.Net library that allows you to easily persist entities in the globally supported Xml standard.
It brings you a fast way to serialize, store and restore your objects with less code-lines than you ever seen.
It's user friendly and you don't need to create data enviroments in order to deploy your app, Cafeina Xml will
do everything for you.<br /><br />
Cafeina Xml will not replace a DBMS in some enviroments like heavily transactional ones, but it will help you in too many
cases to quickly create and deploy any kind of applications in web or desktop enviroments.<br /><br />
The next version we are preparing, will include features to improve multi-user access and tons of cool things that you'll love.
While we finish it, try this version of Cafeina Xml and be amazed of its easiness and power.<br /><br />
Less Sql, more fun, happy Computing!<br /><br />
Cafeina Team.
